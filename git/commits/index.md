# Commits

Chip's commit conventions are based on [Conventional Commits].

The regular layout of a commit message should look like this.

```plain text
<type>[scope?]: <description>

[body?]

[...footers?]
```

## Header

The header is mandatory, excluding the scope. A type, followed by a colon, and a description must be included.
